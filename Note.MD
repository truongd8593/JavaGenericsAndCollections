Working with IntelliJ:

Step 1: Move arrayList.java to a separated folder.

Step 2: Right click on that folder, select 'Mark directory as' -> Source Root Folder.

Otherwise IntelliJ will complaint about some duplicated classes.

Next time to run another example code, we need to do a similar work around I guess.
